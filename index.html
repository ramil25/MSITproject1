<h1>Project 1: Experiment on Web Browser speed </h1>
<br>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>On this experement the researcher choose four web browsers and test it one by one in terms of startup speed, loading speed of css and javascript and also the used memory of the applications when its running. The four web browser that chose by researcher are the <strong>Chrome</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong>, <strong>Opera</strong> and <strong>Brave</strong>. After the procedures of testing in that four web browsers the researcher found that every web browser is better than others in term of other aspect.</p>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Now a day many people looks for a better web browser that they can use easily that not requires lots of things before they can use it. One aspect that they look for in  web browser is the speed of loading when opening it and also how long it takes to load a website or page. Even if many web browser exist in internet we can`t tell what web browser is better to use that`s why in one computer they are installing two or more web browser to have a choice.</p>

<p>Since people wants many choices of web browsers different developers trying to develop a better web browsers that will add to the options of users. When developing a web browser they look for features that the other web browser doesn`t have therefore the people will choose it than others but still fastiest to load is the better because if there are many features in web browsers there are a big chance to get it slower.</p>

<p>Topic like this is interested, so the researcher perform the experiment to know what web browser is best choice for all the users. But the researcher only chose four web browser to be subject for the experiment. Since its only four we did not tell if theres more better than the four choices but atleast it will help to minimize the options of the users of browser.</p>

<p>After this experiment you will findout what web browser will going to be the better one among the four. On this experement researcher choose <strong>Chrome</strong>,<strong>Safari</strong>,<strong>Opera</strong> and <strong>Brave</strong>. Opera,Chrome and Safari is old web browser and the newest among the four is the <em>Brave</em>. On this experiment we're going to compare the three old web browser to only one new web browser to know if we need to migrate to new web browser or stay for the old web browser.</p><br>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<ol>
	<li><h3>Restart the computer</h3><em>To refresh the ram of the computer</em></li>
	<li><h3>Measuring the speed of start-up of the following:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Chrome</em></li>
			<li><em>Safari</em></li>
			<li><em>Opera</em></li>
			<li><em>Brave</em></li>
		</ul><em>Finding the difference speed in term of start-up on the four web browsers.</em>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Measuring the speed of loading of the CSS</h3>
	<em>To know what browser is fastiest among the four in term of loading CSS file.</em>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Measuring the speed of loading of the Javascript</h3>
	<em>To know what browser is fastiest among the four in term of loading javascript file.</em>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Measuring the memory used of the browser</h3>
	<em>To know what browser is the lessen memory use among the four</em>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Encode to excel all the result of measurement.</h3>
	<em>This steps needed for creating a graph later.</em>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Create a Graph of diffrent measurement</h3>
	<em>Create a graph to be easy to see what is the better among the four</em>
	</li>

</ol>
<br>
<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>The following graph is the result of measurement of different metrix.</p><br>
<h3>Start-up speed test</h3>
<img src="1.png" width="500" height="300">
<p>On start-up speed test the fastiest one is the <strong>Brave</strong>. As you can see on the graph above the brave faster of 5 miliseconds among the other</p>

<h3>Loading of CSS File test</h3>
<img src="2.png" width="500" height="300">
<p>On CSS File loading speed test the fastiest one is the <strong>Chrome</strong>. As you can see on the graph above the Chrome took only 5 mili-seconds to load the first css file while the other took more than 10 mili-seconds</p>

<h3>Loading of javascript File speed test</h3>
<img src="3.png" width="500" height="300">
<p>On Javascript File loading speed test the fastiest one is the <strong>Opera</strong>. As you can see on the graph above the Opera took only less 100 mili-seconds to load the first javascript file while the other took more than 100 mili-seconds</p>

<h3>Memory used measurement</h3>
<img src="4.png" width="500" height="300">
<p>On Memory used test the lessen memory used is the <strong>Safari</strong>. As you can see on the graph above the Safari took only less 40mb while the other took more than 40mb.</p>

<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Now as we saw the results of this experiments the four web browser that we use  to test are all better on different metrix. In start-up speed test the better result is the brave, in other side the the safari is better among the three in terms of memory used by the RAM(Random Access Memory). when we look for other metrix the Opera is better than other three in terms of loading javascript file speed and in the last in loading CSS File speed test chrome is the fastest among the three. So it conclude that every web browser is good enough but  on different chracteristics</p><br>
